# JaMu-ADS
JaMu Automatic Documents Sharing (ADS) by email notification from a repository is a tool useful for education, organisations and collaboration teams who want to share documents automatically when posted, uploaded or released and is based on open source developed by Jacob Munodawafa (http://www.jacobmunodawafa.com, jacob@jacobmunodawafa.com).  The open source community is diverse and highly motivated.  Yes, you'll be able to find someone who can help you (or that you can help) no matter what your interests are.  Whether it's development or advocacy, open-source software and other collaborative projects benefit through, and because of, community. Unlike with traditional projects that require physical resources, sharing economies are generally only hindered by the number of people contributing to an effort and their ability to acquire and share knowledge.
